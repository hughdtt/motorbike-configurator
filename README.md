# Motorbike Configurator using React Three Fiber (R3F)

This experimental project is a motorbike configurator built using React Three Fiber (R3F), which enables 3D rendering within a React app. It allows the user to view a 3D model of a motorbike and customize the colors of different parts.
It serves as an exploration into the libraries and a basic implementation based on standard techniques.

## Features
- **3D Motorbike Rendering**: Display a 3D model of a motorbike using glTF format.
- **Color Picker**: A HexColorPicker component to allow the user to pick and apply colors to different parts of the motorbike (main body, secondary body, rims).
- **Orbit Controls**: Utilizes OrbitControls for controlling camera rotation.

## Libraries and Tools Used
- **@react-three/fiber**: Core rendering library.
- **@react-three/drei**: Helpers and abstractions for R3F.
- **react-colorful**: For the color picker component.
- **valtio**: For state management.
- **THREE.js**: For working with 3D geometries and materials.

## Project Structure
### Motorbike Component
Renders the motorbike using the glTF model. Allows customization of colors for the main body, secondary body, and rims.

### Picker Component
Contains the user interface for selecting colors using buttons and a color picker.

### App Component
Main application component, integrating the Motorbike and Picker components, and providing camera and lighting setup.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project folder.
3. Run `npm install` to install all the required dependencies.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server (scripts are in package.json)

## Credits
- Motorcycle by Poly by Google [CC-BY] via [Poly Pizza](https://poly.pizza/m/dse64pqMKAR), although I did some editing in Blender to seperate the model into distinguishable parts.
- Motorbike R3F function auto-generated by: [gltfjsx](https://github.com/pmndrs/gltfjsx), then adapted manually by me.
